# Troubleshooting/some notes
* This project was tested using chrome 56 on osx sierra only.
* with more time would refactor and dry out much of the server side code.
* not much attention was paid to security or hardening.
* the DB for this project is completely mocked out and no actual DB was used.
* the texting feature requires adding a new phone number to the trial twillio account
